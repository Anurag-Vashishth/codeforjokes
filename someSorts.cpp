Some very interesting sorting algorithms are-

        1.)Hitler Sort-Hitler Sort is the best sorting algorithm as 
        it works in O(1).In hitler sort,you basically name the array-"Jews",
        and then delete it.

        2.)Modi Sort- Modiji is sometimes compared to hitler but ironically
        modi sort is slowest as it works in O(n!).In modi sort ,you basically
        keep trying different combinations and when array doesn't get sorted quickly
        ,you simply say-"Are congress ne 70 saal me konsa array sort kiya".

        This method of sorting is also called as blame referencing, where the current admin
        references the blame to the previous admin.

        3.)SBI sort- This is even faster sorting algorithm as it works in O(0)!!!
        Yes you heard it write,O(0)!!!!
        In SBI sort,you dont sort the array at all. You just sit and tell the array 
        that-"Lunch ka time ho gaya hai,baad me aana!!"


        4.) CAA-NRC sort- This sort works in O(n).
        Basically you first traverse the array and push any element thats out of order in a second array.
        Then you traverse the second the array and delete all the muslim elements.
        After this,you push the second array back in first array.Bazinga!!!

        To ease this process the CAA-NRC sort passes the elements of the array through a bool function
        named isMuslim(), if the element on passing it through this function gives out true, is added 
        to another array named second_degree_citizen, and when all the elements are passed through the function
        and the new array is complete, the admin and only the admin is allowed to delete it.
        Now the original array is sorted and you finally get the sorted array named hindu_rashtra 

        5.)Therapist-sort- This is by far the best sorting algorithm ever created.
        It works in O(-n)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        Yes,again,you heard it right!!
        "HOW?"-you may ask.
        Well,in this sort basically you dont sort the array ,and as it turns out
        the array sorts you,your life,your problems,everything. The array asks you if you're mental health
        is fine and tells you that ,"Its okay to be sad sometimes.Its okay to feel lonely or incompetent or
        overwhelmed or insecure by this rapidly changing competetive world. YOU ARE ENOUGH."Then it iterates
        through all your problems and solves them.This sort is very wholesome. 

        Although as helpful this sorting method is, it is not free, because not every array deserves to be 
        this sorted.
