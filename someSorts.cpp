/*
Some very interesting sorting algorithms are-

        1.)Hitler Sort-Hitler Sort is the best sorting algorithm as 
        it works in O(1).In hitler sort,you basically name the array-"Jews",
        and then delete it.

        2.)Modi Sort- Modiji is sometimes compared to hitler but ironically
        modi sort is slowest as it works in O(n!).In modi sort ,you basically
        keep trying different combinations and when array doesn't get sorted quickly
        ,you simply say-"Are congress ne 70 saal me konsa array sort kiya".

        3.)SBI sort- This is even faster sorting algorithm as it works in O(0)!!!
        Yes you heard it write,O(0)!!!!
        In SBI sort,you dont sort the array at all. You just sit and tell the array 
        that-"Lunch ka time ho gaya hai,baad me aana!!"

        4.) CAA-NRC sort- This sort works in O(n).
        Basically you first traverse the array and push any element thats out of order in a second array.
        Then you traverse the second the array and delete all the muslim elements.
        After this,you push the second array back in first array.Bazinga!!!
